# End-to-End Arrival Forecasting: Data Analysis, ARIMA & Visualization

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **time series forecasting workflow** to analyze historical arrival data and predict future arrivals using **ARIMA models**.  
The goal is to convert raw data into **actionable insights and reliable forecasts** that support planning and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical arrival trends and seasonal patterns
- Build and optimize ARIMA models for accurate forecasting
- Evaluate model performance using statistical error metrics
- Visualize trends, forecasts, and insights in an intuitive way

---

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values and time indexing
- Trend, seasonality, and stationarity analysis
- Visualization of historical arrival patterns

---

## 🧠 Modeling Approach
- Applied **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** for time series forecasting
- Identified optimal parameters using model tuning
- Evaluated models using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Selected the best-performing model for future forecasting

---

## 📈 Forecasting Results
- Generated future arrival forecasts based on historical trends
- Compared actual vs predicted values
- Interpreted forecast results for business and operational use cases

---

## 📊 Visualization & Dashboard
- Built clear visualizations to explain:
  - Historical trends
  - Forecasted values
  - Model performance
- Created an interactive dashboard using **Power BI** to communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib  
- **Modeling:** ARIMA (Time Series Analysis)  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Excel  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
